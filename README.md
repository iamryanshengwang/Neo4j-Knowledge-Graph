# Prometheus Chatbot: Knowledge Graph Collaborative Large Language Model for Computer Components Recommendation

During my internship as an algorithm engineer at Lenovo, I developed the Prometheus chatbot with support from Songhao Chen at the Desktop Computing Lab at Lenovo. The primary goal of this project is to simplify document interactions and extract valuable information using natural language. Built with LangChain and GPT-4/ChatGPT, the Prometheus chatbot provides users with a seamless and natural conversational experience. It supports both Azure OpenAI Services and OpenAI.

Abstract. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are becoming fundamental in various applications such as network alignment, question-answering, and recommender systems (RSs) since they offer structured relational data that facilitate the inference of indirect relationships. However, the development of KG-based RSs capable of processing user inputs in natural language faces significant challenges. Firstly, natural language processing units must effectively handle the ambiguity and variability in human language to interpret user intents accurately. Secondly, the system must precisely identify and link entities, like product names, to their corresponding nodes in KGs. To overcome these challenges, supported by Lenovo, we developed a novel chatbot “Prometheus” integrating KG with a large language model (LLM), specifically used for recommending computer components. This chatbot can accurately decode user requests and deliver personalized recommendations derived from KGs, ensuring precise comprehension and response to their computer setup needs.
